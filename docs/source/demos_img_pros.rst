Demonstration of images processing
=================================

The animations below demonstrate the images processing of NGC309 (top) and M51 (bottom). In the animations, images produced at each step in the images processing are shown. Overall, the steps in images processing, especially that are shown (highlighted) in this animation are: cropping, PSF matching, reprojection and spatial resampling.
