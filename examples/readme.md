# Demonstration
This folder contains jupyter notebook files that show the step-by-step process on deriving spatially resolved stellar population properties of 
a galaxy (in this example: NGC309) using **piXedfit**, including image processing, spatial matching between post-processed images and IFS data, pixel binning, 
SED fitting, and obtaining spatially resolved maps of stellar population properties from the SED fitting results.
